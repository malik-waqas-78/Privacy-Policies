    <h1>Privacy Policy for Kortex</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated: September 5, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Kortex ("the App") collects, uses, and protects your information. Kortex is designed with your privacy as a core principle. It is a fully offline application.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> Kortex does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from its users. We do not ask for your name, email address, location, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All data you create within the App, including your boards, cards, tasks, and any associated content, is stored exclusively on your local device. This data is not uploaded to any servers, cloud services, or shared with any third parties.</li>
        <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> Kortex does not use any third-party analytics tools or services that track your usage or behavior within the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internet Permission:</strong> The App may request internet permission. This permission is solely used for displaying external web content, such as a privacy policy hosted online (if applicable) or other informational links that you explicitly choose to open. Kortex does not use this permission to transmit your personal data or any data created within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Permissions:</strong> Kortex aims to minimize permission requests. Any other permissions requested by the App are strictly for core functionality and will be clearly explained at the point of request by your operating system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data is primarily dependent on the security of your device. We recommend that you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep your device secure with a strong password or biometric authentication.</li>
        <li>Regularly back up your device data, as uninstalling the app or factory resetting your device will permanently delete your Kortex data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
