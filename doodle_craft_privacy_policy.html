    <h1>Privacy Policy for Doodle Craft</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Doodle Craft handles your information. This is a locally-run application and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on remote servers.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Doodle Craft does not collect any personally identifiable information. All data, including your drawings and application settings, is stored exclusively on your device.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Doodle Craft requests the following permissions to function correctly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</strong> This permission is required on older Android versions (Android 9 / API 28 and below) to save your drawings to your device's public gallery. On newer versions of Android, this permission is not required as the app uses modern storage access methods.</li>
        <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> This permission is included for potential future features, such as accessing online resources or providing updates. The current version of the app functions entirely offline.</li>
        <li><strong>AD_ID (Advertising ID):</strong> This permission is declared by a library but is explicitly removed during the build process (`tools:node="remove"`). Doodle Craft does not collect, use, or share your advertising ID.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The application uses the data it has access to solely for its core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Drawings you create are saved to your device's local storage at your request.</li>
        <li>A history of your saved drawings is maintained within the app's private storage on your device for you to access, edit, or delete.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data created by Doodle Craft, including images and history metadata, is stored locally on your device. This data is not shared with any third parties and is not accessible to us. If you uninstall the application, the private data associated with the app (like the drawing history database) will be removed.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Doodle Craft does not use any third-party services, analytics, or advertising frameworks. The application functions entirely offline and does not make any external network requests.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Any changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
