    <h1>Privacy Policy for FinFolio</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 4, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>FinFolio is a privacy-first, offline personal finance management application. This Privacy Policy explains how FinFolio handles your information. By using FinFolio, you agree to the terms of this policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>All financial data you enter into FinFolio is stored exclusively on your local device.</strong> This includes your folios, transactions, budgets, and any other financial information. FinFolio does NOT collect, transmit, or store any of your personal or financial data on external servers, cloud services, or any other remote location.</p>
    <p>Your data remains entirely under your control on your device.</p>

    <h2>3. Internet Permissions</h2>
    <p>FinFolio requests the <code>android.permission.INTERNET</code> permission. This permission is used exclusively for the following purpose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To launch an external web browser to display this Privacy Policy, which may be hosted online in future updates or for external links related to app support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The app's core financial tracking features are 100% offline and do not require internet access for their functionality.</p>

    <h2>4. AD_ID Permission</h2>
    <p>The <code>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID</code> permission may be included in the app's manifest. This is for potential future monetization via a free, ad-supported version. The initial release of FinFolio is ad-free, and this permission is currently not utilized for tracking or advertising purposes within the app's current functionality.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Backup and Restore</h2>
    <p>FinFolio provides functionality for you to manually back up your local database to a location of your choosing on your device, and to restore it from a previously saved backup. This process is entirely managed by you, the user, and FinFolio does not automatically handle or store your backups.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the app's support channels or via the developer contact information provided on the app store listing.</p>
