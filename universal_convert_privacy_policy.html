    <h1>Privacy Policy for Universal Converter</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 30, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the Universal Converter application ("the App"). The App is designed to be a private and secure utility. Your privacy is critically important to us.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        We are committed to transparency about the data the App interacts with. Here is a detailed breakdown:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Personal Data Collected:</strong> The Universal Converter App <strong>does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII)</strong>. We do not ask for, access, or store your name, email address, location, phone number, or any other personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Usage Data Collected:</strong> The core functionality of the App does not collect any data about how you use it (e.g., features accessed, frequency of use). However, the App may use third-party advertising services which can collect anonymous usage data to provide personalized ads. This data is not linked to your personal identity by us.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Local Database Storage:</strong> To enhance your experience, the App stores a history of your recent conversions. This conversion history is stored <strong>exclusively in a local database on your device</strong>. This data is not transmitted, shared, or accessible by us or any third parties. It remains on your device for your convenience only.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Permissions Explained</h2>
    <p>
        The Universal Converter App requires the following permissions to function as intended:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong><code>android.permission.INTERNET</code>:</strong> This permission is required to allow third-party advertising networks (such as Google AdMob) to fetch and display advertisements within the App. It may also be used to display this privacy policy from a web source.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><code>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID</code>:</strong> This permission is used by Google Play services to provide a unique, user-resettable advertising ID. This ID is used by advertising networks for analytics and to serve more relevant ads. It does not contain any personally identifiable information.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App may contain advertisements from third-party services (e.g., Google AdMob). These advertisers may use technologies to collect information about your online activities to provide you with relevant advertising. We do not control the data collection practices of these third parties and recommend you review their privacy policies for more information.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
