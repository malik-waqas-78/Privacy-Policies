    <h1>Privacy Policy for FocusFlow</h1>
    <p>Last updated: September 1, 2025</p>

    <p>FocusFlow is a minimalist, offline Pomodoro-style timer designed to help users enhance their productivity. This Privacy Policy describes how FocusFlow collects, uses, and discloses your information.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>FocusFlow is designed to be an offline application. We do not collect any personal data from our users. All data, including your focus session history and app settings, is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>FocusFlow requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>VIBRATE (<code>android.permission.VIBRATE</code>):</strong> This permission is used to provide subtle haptic feedback upon the completion of a focus or break session, enhancing the user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>WAKE_LOCK (<code>android.permission.WAKE_LOCK</code>):</strong> This permission is used to prevent the device from sleeping during active timer sessions, ensuring that the timer runs uninterrupted.</li>
        <li><strong>INTERNET (<code>android.permission.INTERNET</code>):</strong> This permission is included for potential future integration of advertisements or analytics services. Currently, FocusFlow does not utilize this permission for data transmission.</li>
        <li><strong>AD_ID (<code>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID</code>):</strong> This permission is included to support potential future monetization through advertising. Currently, FocusFlow does not display ads or use this permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>FocusFlow uses Jetpack DataStore for storing user preferences (e.g., custom durations, theme choice, haptic feedback preference) and Room Database for storing daily focus session history. This data is stored exclusively on your device and is not accessible by us.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
