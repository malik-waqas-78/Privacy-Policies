  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: November 2, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the QR Scanner app (“we,” “our,” or “us”) handles information in compliance with Google Play policies and applicable privacy regulations.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not collect, store, or share any personal data</strong> from our users. The QR Scanner app only uses the information entered by the user locally on their device to generate or scan QR codes. No entered data is transmitted to our servers or stored externally.</p>

  <h2>Permissions Used and Their Purpose</h2>
  <p>The app requires the following permissions solely for core functionality. We do not misuse or collect data through these permissions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CAMERA:</strong> Used to scan QR codes through the device’s camera. The app does not record or store any images or videos.</li>
    <li><strong>VIBRATE:</strong> Allows the device to provide haptic feedback (vibration) when a QR code is successfully scanned.</li>
    <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Required to display ads from Google AdMob and to connect to Wi-Fi networks whose credentials are scanned via QR codes. The app itself does not send or receive any personal user data over the internet.</li>
    <li><strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> Used to check network connectivity to ensure stable Wi-Fi connections and proper ad functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE / CHANGE_WIFI_STATE:</strong> Used to check available Wi-Fi networks and allow the user to connect automatically to a Wi-Fi network whose QR code was scanned. No Wi-Fi credentials or personal network data are collected or transmitted.</li>
    <li><strong>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID:</strong> Used by Google AdMob for serving personalized or non-personalized ads according to Google’s advertising policies. We do not have access to users’ advertising IDs.</li>
    <li><strong>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</strong> Used to store generated QR code images when users choose to save or share them. The files remain local to the device.</li>
    <li><strong>android.hardware.camera.any:</strong> Indicates that the app can use any available camera for QR scanning purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our app may include third-party services, such as Google AdMob, which may collect certain types of data automatically for advertising and analytics purposes. These third-party providers follow their own privacy policies and are fully responsible for how they handle such data. You can review Google’s Privacy Policy here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>Since we do not collect or store user data, there is no risk of data breaches from our side. However, users are encouraged to use the app responsibly and keep their device secure.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app does not knowingly collect or request any personal information from children under the age of 13. As no data collection occurs, the app is safe for general use.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to comply with legal or operational requirements. Users are encouraged to review this page for the latest version. The updated policy will be effective immediately upon posting.</p>

  <p>By using the QR Scanner app, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
