  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: November 2, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the QR Scanner app (“we,” “our,” or “us”) handles information in compliance with Google Play policies and applicable privacy regulations.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not collect, store, or share any personal data</strong> from our users. The QR Scanner app only uses the information entered by the user locally on their device to generate or scan QR codes. No entered data is transmitted to our servers or stored externally.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our app may include third-party services, such as Google AdMob, which may collect certain types of data automatically for advertising and analytics purposes. These third-party providers follow their own privacy policies and are fully responsible for how they handle such data. You can review Google’s Privacy Policy here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>Since we do not collect or store user data, there is no risk of data breaches from our side. However, users are encouraged to use the app responsibly and keep their device secure.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app does not knowingly collect or request any personal information from children under the age of 13. As no data collection occurs, the app is safe for general use.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to comply with legal or operational requirements. Users are encouraged to review this page for the latest version. The updated policy will be effective immediately upon posting.</p>

  <p>By using the QR Scanner app, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
