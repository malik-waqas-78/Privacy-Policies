  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: November 2, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the QR Scanner app (“we,” “our,” or “us”) handles information in compliance with Google Play policies and applicable privacy regulations.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
  <p>While the QR Scanner app does not directly collect, store, or share any personal data that you input for generating or scanning QR codes (this data remains local to your device), we do utilize third-party services that may automatically collect certain data for analytics and advertising purposes.</p>
  <p>Specifically, we use Google Firebase services, including Firebase Analytics and Firebase Realtime Database. Firebase Analytics automatically collects data about your device and how you use the app to help us understand user behavior and improve the app. This may include device identifiers (like Android Advertising ID), device information (OS, model), app usage data (e.g., app opens, screen views, session duration), and general geographical data. Firebase Realtime Database stores data that is explicitly configured by the app developer, and in this application, it is used to manage certain app configurations and potentially non-personal usage statistics, without storing any personal user-entered QR code content.</p>
  <p>No entered data for QR code generation or scanning is transmitted to our servers or stored externally by us. Any data collected by third-party services is handled according to their respective privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>Permissions Used and Their Purpose</h2>
  <p>The app requires the following permissions solely for core functionality. We do not misuse or collect data through these permissions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CAMERA:</strong> Used to scan QR codes through the device’s camera. The app does not record or store any images or videos.</li>
    <li><strong>VIBRATE:</strong> Allows the device to provide haptic feedback (vibration) when a QR code is successfully scanned.</li>
    <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Required to display ads from Google AdMob and to connect to Wi-Fi networks whose credentials are scanned via QR codes. The app itself does not send or receive any personal user data over the internet.</li>
    <li><strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> Used to check network connectivity to ensure stable Wi-Fi connections and proper ad functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE / CHANGE_WIFI_STATE:</strong> Used to check available Wi-Fi networks and allow the user to connect automatically to a Wi-Fi network whose QR code was scanned. No Wi-Fi credentials or personal network data are collected or transmitted.</li>
    <li><strong>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID:</strong> Used by Google AdMob for serving personalized or non-personalized ads according to Google’s advertising policies. We do not have access to users’ advertising IDs.</li>
    <li><strong>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</strong> Used to store generated QR code images when users choose to save or share them. The files remain local to the device.</li>
    <li><strong>android.hardware.camera.any:</strong> Indicates that the app can use any available camera for QR scanning purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our app integrates with several third-party services that may collect and process data. These providers operate under their own privacy policies and are responsible for their data handling practices.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used for serving personalized or non-personalized advertisements. AdMob may collect device identifiers (like Android Advertising ID), device information, and app usage data for advertising and analytics. You can review Google’s Privacy Policy here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase (Analytics and Realtime Database):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Automatically collects data about your device and app usage, such as device identifiers, device information (OS, model), app usage data (e.g., app opens, screen views, session duration), and general geographical data. This helps us understand user behavior and improve the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Realtime Database:</strong> Used to store app configurations and non-personal usage statistics. The data stored in the Realtime Database is controlled by the app developer and is encrypted in transit and at rest.</li>
      </ul>
      You can find more information about Firebase privacy and security here: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>While we do not directly collect or store personal user data from QR code content, data collected by integrated third-party services (like Firebase Analytics) is subject to their security measures. We strive to use services that prioritize data security. Users are encouraged to use the app responsibly and keep their device secure.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app does not knowingly collect or request any personal information from children under the age of 13. As no data collection occurs, the app is safe for general use.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to comply with legal or operational requirements. Users are encouraged to review this page for the latest version. The updated policy will be effective immediately upon posting.</p>

  <p>By using the QR Scanner app, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
