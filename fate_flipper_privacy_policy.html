    <h1>Privacy Policy for Fate Flipper</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 5, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Fate Flipper ("we," "our," "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect your information when you use our mobile application, Fate Flipper (the "App").</p>
    <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Fate Flipper is designed to be a private and secure utility. We do not collect any personally identifiable information from you. All data you create is stored locally on your device.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Generated Data:</strong> The primary data the App handles is the custom lists and items you create for the "List Picker" feature. This data is stored exclusively in a local database on your device. It is not transmitted, shared, or stored on any external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> The App does not collect analytics or usage data. We do not track how you use the app's features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal information, we do not use it for any purpose. The data you create within the App is used solely to provide the App's core functionality, such as allowing you to save, manage, and get random selections from your lists.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All data, including your custom lists, is stored in a local Room database on your device. This means you have full control over your data. If you uninstall the App, all of its data will be permanently deleted from your device. We take reasonable measures to protect the information stored within the App's local database, but no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Fate Flipper requests the following permissions to function correctly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><code>android.permission.INTERNET</code></strong>: This permission is included for potential future features that may require network access, such as cloud backups (as an opt-in feature) or to display non-personalized ads. Currently, the App is fully functional offline and does not use this permission.</li>
        <li><strong><code>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID</code></strong>: This permission allows the app to access the Advertising ID on your device. This identifier is used by advertising networks to serve ads. While the app does not currently serve ads, this permission is included in preparation for potential future monetization to support the app's development. We will not use this permission to track you or build a profile of your behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not currently integrate with any third-party services that would collect information from you.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
